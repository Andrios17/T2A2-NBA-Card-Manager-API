# T2A2-NBA-Card-Manager-API

Sport card collecting, specifically NBA cards, is a very popular hobby within Australia. The hobby broke out into the mainstream during the pandemic where thousands of individuals began to collect and sell cards. During this time, listings for cards on auction applications such as EBay and Facebook Marketplace increased by 300%. However, despite this, physical store locations which specalise in sport card collecting have rapidly closed. In Sydney alone, there is no specific physcial store front which sells and is committed to purely sport card sales. This lack of a gathering place has hindered the hobbys growth within Australia as there is no place for individuals who are in invested in this hobby to meet and grow the community to levels it is at in other parts of the world such as America. As such, I have developed an API which is beginning to build the back bone of a web application a place to build that sense of community.

This API has the ability to allow registered users to build their card collection and show it off to other registered users, blog about their card collecting journey and place their cards on auction. The hope is that providing a centralised platform where users can both socialise and auction their cards to others in the hobby, the NBA card hobby can grow in a healthy way.
