# T2A2-NBA-Card-Manager-API

Sport card collecting, specifically NBA cards, is a very popular hobby within Australia. The hobby broke out into the mainstream during the pandemic where thousands of individuals began to collect and sell cards. During this time, listings for cards on auction applications such as EBay and Facebook Marketplace increased by 300%. However, despite this, physical store locations have since closed. In Sydney alone, there is no specific physcial store front which sells and is committed to purely sport card sales. This lack of a gathering place has hindered the hobbys growth within Australia as there is no place for individuals who are in invested in this hobby to meet and grow the community to levels it is at in other parts of the world such as America. As such, I have developed an API which is beginning to build the back bone of a web application which provides individuals both a meeting place, as well as a method to show off their coveted collections and trade cards with other individuals.
